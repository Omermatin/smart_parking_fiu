Project Overview

The Smart Parking Recommendation system is a Flutter-based mobile feature designed to optimize student parking at Florida International University (FIU). It analyzes a studentâ€™s class schedule and the real-time availability of parking garages to recommend the best parking slot, reducing walking distance and saving time.

This project was developed as part of a Sprinternship with PantherSoft and is expected to be integrated into the official FIU Mobile App with potential future enhancements.

Problem Statement

Students at FIU often face difficulty finding available parking close to their classes, leading to:

1) Late arrivals

2) Increased walking distance across campus

3) Frustration and inefficiency

The goal of this project is to automate parking selection using a schedule-aware recommendation algorithm using n8n for smart suggestions, prioritizing convenience and real-time availability.

Technical Highlights:

  Flutter & Dart: Frontend interface with state management and responsive design

  REST API Integration: Fetches student schedule and garage availability

  Local Algorithmic Processing: All recommendation logic is handled on-device; no backend server required

  Data Parsing & Modeling: JSON responses are mapped to custom Dart data models

  Scalable Architecture: Easily extendable to include new features like parking history, AI-based predictions, and alternative routes
